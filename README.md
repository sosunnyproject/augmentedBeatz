MIT virtually reality hackathon 2016 Hololens project

October 2016 at MIT Media Lab

## Ideas
- One of the teammates was DJ
- I was also interested in live music scene and making it more efficient via technology
- Wanted to try out Hololens kit, since its hella expensive to personally buy

## Objective
- Improve mobility, environment-friendliness of live music scene by replacing huge set/equipment

## Tools
- Microsoft Hololens
- HoloToolkit Unity Package
- 3D/2D design softwares
- audio editing software

## Improvement/Questions
- Need to connect Hololens (audio) to bluetooth speaker 
- Can a huge speaker be stably connected to this?
- Hololens is too bulky to wear for more than 10 minutes..
- Hololens gesture options are too limited and recognition isn't fast enough for rapid movement
